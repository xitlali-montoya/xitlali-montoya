 I am a sophomore at Yale University majoring in Computer Science. I'm very passionate about promoting and empowering Latinas in Computer Science, a severely underrepresented group in the field and in STEM overall. I'm also passionate about promoting diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. I am a member of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) at Yale and Secretary of Latina Women at Yale.
